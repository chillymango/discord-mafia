# TODO List

Here's a list of shit I should do

## Features
### Mechanics
* [p0] CRIMES ARE MISSING BRO
    * investigator will not trigger crimes on themselves?
    * we can make crimes proc before action results go...?
    * never mind we can't because we need action result first
    * that means that investigator needs two actions, PreInvestigate and Investigate, where PreInvestigate will just leave a trespassing crime
* [p1] Status ailments
    * can implement silencing, dousing, etc. this way
    * dynamic criteria that persist against an Actor model

### Roles (these are all p[1])
* Auditor
* Witch
* Bus Driver
* Enchantress
* Party Host
* Triad Faction
* Soldato?
    * this one looks kinda dumb tbvh
* Oracle (ayyy)
* Amnesiac role
* Executioner role
* Cultists
* Disguiser? I'm literally not sure how to do this though
    * we could switch nicknames but if people clue onto this it's tough so almost definitely not
* Arsonist

### Game Buttons
* [p1] Suicide button

### Achievements!!!
* [p2] Points system
* [p2] Copy a bunch of the achievements from SC2 Mafia 

### AI Improvements
* [p0] Bots should never be assigned advanced roles
* [p2] ChatGPT integration for decision making
    * this may be a lot easier after game log? the thing is i feel like that's cheating
    * since we're getting closer and closer to just telling chatgpt what to do straight up

### QoL
* [p0] 
* [p0] Setup Config
    * Config editor is [p2], would be nice to have, but editing a JSON for now should be OK
* [p1] Flying windows?
* [p2] Mobile experience?
    * this one might just be kinda fucked for speed Mafia, maybe OK for forum Mafia
* [p2] Target Titles for everybody

### Maintenance
* [p1] Unit tests for engine
* [p2] Unit tests for Chat API (this seems harder to do)

## Refactoring
### p0 (this shit is beyond disgusting)
* [p0] Game events / game log abstraction for events
    * basically everything we do should emit an event and we should log it

### p1 (it's not great but it's OK)
* [p1] Jail should be its own class with game logic separated from rendering / Discord control
* [p1] Server setup script

### p2 (it's shameful but acceptable)
* [p2] Chat controller type for TownHall, Court, Hideouts, etc.
    * TownHall shouldn't control all of them probably
* [p2] Cleanup dead files (e.g input_panel.py)

## Balance / Game Design
### Meta Analysis
* [p1] What do we want setups to look like
* [p1] Standard list of setups for speed vs forum Mafia
